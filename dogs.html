                Hello All! I would like to introduce you to the fluffiest, loving, slobberiest beasts
                I have ever had the joy to know! These are my babies! As every parent of a pet knows,
                animals hold a large section of our hearts and today I would like to help you understand
                just how amazing and wonderful my sweet little ones are!

                    My sweet boy Paxy is almost six years old. I don't know what I would do without him.
                    He is always there to be my shoulder to cry on when I am upset and he is always the
                    first on my tail when something is going on, he has to be where the action is.  If we
                    sit on the couch and ignore him to long he will purposly sit with his back towards us
                    but as close as possible, as if to say "I'm hurt your not paying attention to me or
                    inviting me up" and will occationally turn his head in an, I don't care, type way, but with
                    those doleful pleeding eyes.  He loves to play fetch and hide-and-seek. If a visitor
                    comes over, you better watch out, all 100lb of pax will be jummping up on you for
                    kisses and love!

                <p class="bio">
                    Syl, short for Sylphrenna, short for Sylly Goose is the cuddliest little fluff ball
                    you've ever seen.  For sure she would go with any stranger who is willing to give her
                    a hug.  This is Pax's girlfriend, she follows him everywhere and she loves to cuddle
                    with him.  We brought her home when she was 10 weeks old, she is now two and a half
                    years old.  She is a lazy brick house, if you sit on the floor she will lay right
                    ontop of you, her snout in your face for kisses.  Be careful not to leave the door
                    open while you sleep unless you want to wake up to 95lbs of fluff laying on your legs.

                    Phendoranna, or Phenny Penny as I call her is a nervouse and shy girl, but she has a
                    huge personality.  She loves guests, she will sneek up to someone new when they aren't
                    looking and bound away when the person looks at her. When she trusts you though you can
                    tell in her eyes, when she comes up on the couch she has to be on my lap and will lean
                    in untill she is rolling her face on mine.  She likes to lay on my chest and stare in my
                    eyes, I can almost tell she is saying "I trust you".  When Phen is excited she does the
                    cutest 180 turns, jummping in circles, 3-4 at a time.  She loves to play karate, throwing
                    her paws out and bounding. When she doesn't want to eat she will play hocky with he food
                    bowl, pushing it to me, I push it to her. back and forth.  Phen and Syl have the best
                    relationship being that they are litter mates. They will cuddle and roll ontop of each
                    other, even now that they are no longer puppies.

            <h1 class="title">About Their Breeds</h1>

            <p class="main-ph">
                Every dog breed has its own set of traits and mannerisms which are generally
                but not always present in each dog.  Just like with humans, every
                dog is an individual, whith their own personality.  Pax is a Husky-English Labrador
                mix. He has to be mixed with something else as he is so large, but those are the Two
                breeds we know he comes from.  Syl and Phen are Great Pyreneese-Anatolian Shepherd
                mixes. I can see many of the traits which are expected for each breed in my dogs. But
                ofcourse they come with their own special traits too.  Below we will be looking at
                the general traits of each of these four breeds.  Please refer to the links below for
                more information.

            <h4 class="min-title">About Huskys</h4>
            <p class="min-ph">
                Huskys are generaly very affectionate with their families as well as other dogs and
                children. They are quick to make friends with strangers but have a tendancy to bark
                or howl at potential threats, such as a bird or a squirrel.  They have a double coat
                to keep them warm in the winter, but for an owner it means lots and lots of grooming
                and vacuuming. Huskys have a lot of energy and love to play.  They have a moderate
                trainability level, meaning they are independent, but if you are consistent they will
                be easily trained. They are born pack animals and get along well with other animals.
            </p>
            <h4 class="mini-title">Pax compared to general Husky traits</h4>
            <p class="mini-ph">
                Pax is such a sweet loving boy who makes friends with everyone he meets.  He can be very high
                energy but he understands how to be gentle when the time calls for it, when interacting with
                puppies or children.  He does shed ALL THE TIME, but the zoomies, cuddles, and
                hide-and-seek make the cleaning worth it.  He loves to bark at animals outside as well as
                bark and growl while playing.  It is very true that he is a pack animal.  We ended up
                adopting the girls specificly for Pax, you could tell he was lonely and he wanted a friend.
                He fell inlove with the girls right away and would constantly try to share his toys with
                them.  Though it took him time to get used to sharing his bed.

        <div class="section">
            <h4 class="min-title">About English Labradors</h4>
            <p class="min-ph">
                English labradors are very affectionate and playful. They are generally a very good family
                pet, being that they are good with children and strangers alike. They can be very easily
                trained as they are eager to please and do well with mental stimulation.  They do shed a
                lot however as they have a second coat.

        <div class="section">
            <h4 class="min-title">About Great Pyrenees</h4>
            <p class="min-ph">
                Great Pyrenees dogs are considered to be very affectionate and cuddly with their family.
                When you adopt one it means that they are part of the family. They are decent with other
                dogs and young children.  They do need to be groomed fairly frequently.  They can be
                mildly reserved with strangers, but if their owner says they are fine it should all be good.
                They are made to be a watch dog and work on farms so these dogs will bark at most things.
                They are relativly playful and do need exercise and stimulation.

        <div class="section">
            <h4 class="min-title">About Anatolian Shepherds</h4>
            <p class="min-ph">
                Anatolian Shepherds are very independent dogs which can make them more difficult to train, but
                they will be more willing to listen to you if you provide them with activity, mentelstimulation,
                and respect. They are generally good with other dogs and children Anatolian Shepherds shed
                a decent amount but they do not generally drool. They are generally self-willed and not as focused
                on pleasing their owner.
